### DEFAULT_FOLDER removal ([#24836](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/24836))

`DEFAULT_FOLDER` was originally introduced to work around limitations within the build system.
Parent folders containing common configuration would create invalid build targets.

With the introduction of [`keyboard.json`](./20240526#keyboard-json) as a configuration file, the build system now has a consistent method to detect build targets.
The `DEFAULT_FOLDER` functionality is now redundant and the intent is for `rules.mk` to become pure config.

Backwards compatibility of build targets has been maintained where possible.
